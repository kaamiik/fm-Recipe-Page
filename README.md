### What I learned

I learned a lot from this project. In this project, the structure of HTML is very important and it greatly helps in problem-solving and styling. Also, using a CSS reset is very helpful. One of the main challenges for me in this project was centering the bullets in list items. To solve this problem, I used the following code.

```css
.card__prepration--item--text,
.card__ingredients--item--text {
  display: inline-block;
  vertical-align: middle;
  margin-left: 16px;
}
```

I also used padding to create spaces when writing the CSS codes related to the table.
